# Canistergeek Demo UI

Canistergeek Demo UI is a sample frontend application that utilizes [Canistergeek-IC-JS](https://github.com/usergeek/canistergeek-ic-js).

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can start a development server with:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install
# Start local server on port 3001
npm run start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:3001`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.
