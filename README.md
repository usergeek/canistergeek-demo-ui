Canistergeek Demo UI is a sample frontend application that utilizes [Canistergeek-IC-JS](https://github.com/usergeek/canistergeek-ic-js).

> Canistergeek-IC-JS should be used together with [Canistergeek-IC-Motoko](https://github.com/usergeek/canistergeek-ic-motoko) - open-source tool for Internet Computer to track your project canisters cycles and memory status.

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can start a development server with:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install
# Start local server on port 3001
npm run start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:3001`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.
